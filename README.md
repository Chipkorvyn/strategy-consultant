# Strategy Consultant (a.k.a. Worker)

A Cowork plugin that performs the analytical work of a strategy consultant or any knowledge worker. Takes a business problem from definition through research, validation, synthesis, and delivers an executive-grade deliverable.

## Who It's For

- **Management Consultants** — Strategy and generalist consultants at firms who want to accelerate the research-to-deliverable cycle
- **Corporate Strategy Teams** — In-house strategists running internal engagements for C-suite
- **Corporate Development / M&A** — Teams scoping market entries, acquisitions, and competitive landscapes
- **Independent Advisors / Boutique Firms** — Solo or small-team consultants who need the analytical horsepower of a larger team
- **Any knowledge work** - Any work that requires similar skill

## How It Works

This plugin is designed to handle 80–90% of the analytical workload in a strategy engagement — research, evidence validation, structured synthesis, and report drafting — so that the consultant can focus on the 10–20% that creates unique value: client relationship judgment, proprietary insight, and final recommendations. All outputs are intended as high-quality working drafts for expert review, not finished deliverables.

## What It Does

This plugin runs a complete consulting-grade analytical workflow:

1. **Define the problem** — Sharpens a vague business challenge into a decision-oriented question with clear scope
2. **Structure hypotheses** (optional) — Builds a testable hypothesis tree when the problem benefits from structured decomposition
3. **Research** — Deploys two independent research agents in parallel, then validates findings with a third agent for consistency and source quality
4. **Sense-check** — Pressure-tests all findings through triangulation, steel-manning the counter-argument, math checks, and bias scanning
5. **Synthesize** — Builds a storyline that directly answers the client question, organized by the logic of the answer (not a rigid framework)
6. **Deliver** — Produces an executive-grade Word document with clear language, sourced claims, and zero consulting clichés

## Connectors (Optional)

## Design Principles

- **Delivery mode only** — produces outputs directly, no Socratic coaching
- **Evidence-traced** — every claim in the final report traces back to a sourced finding
- **Bias-resistant** — two independent research threads + validation reduces confirmation bias
- **No forced frameworks** — the storyline structure follows the logic of the answer
- **No clichés** — a comprehensive banned-language list ensures clear, direct executive writing
- **Expert-in-the-loop** — designed as a 80–90% accelerator, not a replacement for professional judgment
