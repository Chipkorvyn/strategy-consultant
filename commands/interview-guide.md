## CONTINUATION COMMAND — do not use as a fresh entry point

This command continues an existing engagement. Before any other tool call:

  1. Check for an engagement workspace (e.g., ./engagement/precision-anchor.md).
  2. If it exists → continue from this phase.
  3. If it does NOT exist → STOP. Invoke /engagement instead. engagement-manager
     will route to the correct starting phase, including this one if appropriate.

Do not attempt to run this phase cold. Upstream artifacts (Precision Anchor,
Client Question Checklist, Source Material Extraction Log, data-source answers)
are produced by earlier phases and required inputs here. Reconstructing them
inside this command is not the fix — routing through engagement-manager is.

**Important**: This plugin assists with strategic analysis and research but does not constitute professional consulting, financial, or legal advice. All outputs should be reviewed by qualified professionals before use in decision-making.

Plan expert interviews and create structured guides that close specific research gaps. Can also process uploaded interview notes or transcripts after interviews are conducted.

## Usage

```
/interview-guide <topic or context>
```

### Arguments

- `topic or context` — What the interviews should cover. Can be:
  - A research topic: "European EV charging market"
  - A reference to prior research: "Based on the research gaps we found"
  - Uploaded interview notes/transcripts to process: "Process these interview notes"
  - A specific expert type: "Prepare for a call with a former VP of Operations at a logistics company"

If no input is provided, prompt the user for the engagement context and research gaps.

## Workflow

This command invokes the **expert-interview** skill, which operates in two modes:

### Mode A: Pre-Interview (Planning)

**Step 1: Identify Gaps**
Review available research findings and identify information gaps that experts can close — particularly claims resting on CS-3 that could be upgraded to CS-2 with expert confirmation.

**Step 2: Define Expert Profiles**
For each priority gap, recommend a specific expert profile with role, qualification, priority level, and company type.

**Step 3: Prioritize**
Rank by impact on the engagement. Recommend 3-5 experts maximum.

**Step 4: Create Interview Guides**
For each expert, produce a structured guide with:
- Context for the interviewer
- 5-8 key questions mapped to specific information gaps
- What we already know vs. what we need from the expert
- Follow-up probes for each question
- Validation section (present 2-3 public research findings for expert to confirm/challenge)
- Closing questions

### Mode B: Post-Interview (Processing)

**Step 1: Extract Claims**
From uploaded notes/transcripts, extract every claim with type (FACT / OPINION / HEARSAY) and confidence score.

**Step 2: Cross-Reference**
Compare every expert claim against public research — classify as Agreement, Enhancement, Conflict, or Net New Insight.

**Step 3: Produce Output**
Structured expert interview output with key findings, cross-reference tables, updated Source Registry entries, and impact on information gaps.

## Output

**Pre-interview**: Expert profiles (prioritized) + structured interview guides with gap mapping

**Post-interview**: Extracted claims with confidence scores, cross-reference against public research, updated Source Registry entries, gap closure assessment
