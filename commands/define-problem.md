description: Sharpen a vague business question into a decision-oriented problem statement with clear scope
argument-hint: "<business challenge, client brief, or RFP>"

## CONTINUATION COMMAND — do not use as a fresh entry point

This command continues an existing engagement. Before any other tool call:

  1. Check for an engagement workspace (e.g., ./engagement/precision-anchor.md).
  2. If it exists → continue from this phase.
  3. If it does NOT exist → STOP. Invoke /engagement instead. engagement-manager
     will route to the correct starting phase, including this one if appropriate.

Do not attempt to run this phase cold. Upstream artifacts (Precision Anchor,
Client Question Checklist, Source Material Extraction Log, data-source answers)
are produced by earlier phases and required inputs here. Reconstructing them
inside this command is not the fix — routing through engagement-manager is.

# /define-problem — Problem Definition

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

**Important**: This plugin assists with strategic analysis and research but does not constitute professional consulting, financial, or legal advice. All outputs should be reviewed by qualified professionals before use in decision-making.

Take a vague business challenge and distill it into a problem statement sharp enough to drive analysis.

## Usage

```
/define-problem <business challenge or brief>
```

### Arguments

- `business challenge or brief` — The starting point. Can be:
  - A vague question: "We need to grow faster"
  - A client brief or RFP (file upload)
  - A project description or meeting transcript
  - A specific but unscoped question: "Should we acquire Company X?"

If no input is provided, prompt the user to supply context.

## Workflow

This command invokes the **problem-definition** skill as a standalone capability.

### Step 1: Extract Raw Situation
Read all provided materials and identify the stated problem, implicit assumptions, and what's missing.

### Step 2: Ask Targeted Questions
Using the AskUserQuestion tool, clarify:
- What decision will this inform?
- Time horizon for action?
- Known constraints?
- Who is the ultimate decision-maker and what do they care about most?

### Step 3: Draft Problem Statement
Produce a structured problem statement:
- **Context**: Client and situation (1-2 sentences)
- **Tension**: What has changed or is at stake (1 sentence)
- **Question**: Specific, decision-oriented question
- **Scope**: Boundaries — geography, time horizon, business unit, constraints

### Step 4: Create Deliverable Blueprint
Envision the ideal successful answer — what the report must contain, how the client uses it, what dimensions must be covered.

### Step 5: Stress-Test
Apply three checks: Partner test, "So what" test, Scope test.

### Step 6: Create Precision Anchor
A compact reference artifact carried through all subsequent phases to prevent analytical drift.

## Output

- Problem statement (Context / Tension / Question / Scope)
- Deliverable Blueprint (structure, must-contain, coverage dimensions, how client uses it)
- Client Question Checklist (every explicit question from source materials)
- Precision Anchor (question, decision, scope, success metric, what precise vs. non-answer looks like)
